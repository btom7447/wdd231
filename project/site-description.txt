Reason for Choosing this Subject:

I chose to develop a workspace hub website because I frequently use the services of a local workspace hub that currently lacks an online presence. By creating a website for this hub, I aim to provide a platform for them to showcase their services, attract new members, and enhance their overall visibility. This project will allow me to apply my web development skills to a real-world problem, while also supporting a business that I believe in.
